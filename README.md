Leap Motion Gesture Control
===========================

Simple system tray application to make use of some Leap Motion gestures:

* Draw a circle to scroll (clockwise for down)
* Make a key tap gesture to move down 1 line
* Swipe Up/Down for `Home/End` key presses
* Swipe Left/Right for `Ctrl+Tab` and `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` (tab switching in most browsers)
